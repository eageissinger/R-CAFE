# R for Coastal and Freshwater Ecology

R training sessions for Coastal and Freshwater Ecology are geared for all levels of R users. Sessions are scheduled for 2 hours. 

Hour 1: "Live coding": instructor teachers material through code in real-time. Participants are encouraged to "code-along" and work through material and exercises throughout the session. 

Hour 2: Coding challenge (optional); participants are also welcome to bring their own data or code to ask questions relevant to the training session.

All material for each training session will be available on this page. 

## Next Training Session
