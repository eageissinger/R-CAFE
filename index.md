# R for Coastal and Freshwater Ecology

R training sessions have finished for the season. The website will be updated with full tutorials by mid-April 2023. Session overview and material is available below.


R training sessions for Coastal and Freshwater Ecology are geared for all levels of R users. Sessions are scheduled for 2 hours. 

Hour 1: "Live coding": instructor teachers material through code in real-time. Participants are encouraged to "code-along" and work through material and exercises throughout the session. 

Hour 2: Coding challenge (optional); participants are also welcome to bring their own data or code to ask questions relevant to the training session.

All material for each training session will be available on this page.
