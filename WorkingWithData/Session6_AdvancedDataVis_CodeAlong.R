# Session 6
# 15 March 2023

# Advanced data visualization

# Objectives:
# customizing and formatting figures with theme
# using multiple geoms 
# multi-panel plots
# adding regression lines to figures
# formatting legends
# exporting figures


# ----- Packages -----
# I use tidyverse packages consistently, so I prefer to use the tidyverse package
# which is a bulk load containing the following packages:
# ggplot2, purr, tibble, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, readr, forcats

# Version 1 (lines 25-31) are for bulk load
# Version 2 (lines 34-42) contains code for individual package upload

# please choose 1.


# if you haven't used these packages before, run the following line of code
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")

# load packages into R
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)


# alternative to loading all of tidyverse
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("ggplot2")

#load packages in R
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)


# ----- Load Data ------
temperature <- read.csv("./data/CHONE121_tanktemperature.csv") # water temperature

LW <- read.csv("./data/CHONE121_codlengthweight.csv") # length and weight data


# ----- Format and summarise data -----

data1 <- temperature |> 
  mutate( Date = ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-" ))) |> # format date
  group_by(Date) |> # group data by date
  summarise(Temp.C = mean(temperature), TempSD = sd(temperature)) # calculate daily temperature across all tanks


data2 <- LW |> 
  mutate( Date = ymd( paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")), # format date
          day.of.year = yday(Date)) |> # day of year
  mutate(day.of.year = replace(day.of.year, day.of.year >= 365, 0) ) |> # replace the two days in december as day 0 (first measurement)
  group_by(tank, day.of.year, size, ration) |> # group by tank, day, size, and ration
  summarise(weight = mean(weight_g), sd_w = sd(weight_g), se_w = sd_w/sqrt(n())) |> # calculate mean weight per tank for each day (each tank represents one value)
  arrange(day.of.year) |> # sort by day
  group_by(tank, size, ration) |> # regroup data
  # calculate SGR using lag()
  mutate(sgr_w = (log(weight) - log(lag(weight))) / (day.of.year - lag(day.of.year)) * 100 ) |>  # SRG = ( ln(w2)-ln(w1) ) / (t2 - t1 ) * 100
  summarise(sgr = mean(sgr_w, na.rm = TRUE) ) |> # average sgr across entire study for each tank
  ungroup() |> 
  mutate(ration = factor(ration)) # convert ration to factor (for graphing)


data3 <- LW |> 
  mutate( Date = ymd( paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")), # format date
          day.of.year = yday(Date)) |> # day of year
  mutate(day.of.year = replace(day.of.year, day.of.year >= 365, 0) ) |> # replace the two days in december as day 0 (first measurement)
  mutate(K = weight_g/(mmSL*0.1)^3*100) |>  # calculate K for each fish
  group_by(tank, day.of.year, size, ration) |> # group by tank, day, size, and ration
  summarise(fulton = mean(K), fulton.sd = sd(K), fulton.se = fulton.sd/sqrt(n()) ) |> # calculate mean K per tank for each day (each tank represents one value)
  ungroup() |> 
  mutate(ration = factor(ration)) # convert ration to factor (for graphing)
  

  
# ----- Figure 1: Temperature (data1) ------
# objectives
# geom_point()
# format points
# add a horizontal line at 0 Â°C
# adjust text themes




# ----- Figure 2: SGR (data2) -----
# introduce geom_boxplot()
# combine with geom_point()
# facet_wrap()
# adjusting facet themes





# ------ Figure 3: condition over time (data3) ------
# combining pipes with ggplot
# geom_point vs geom_jitter
# classify with shapes
# adding regression lines
# formatting legend
